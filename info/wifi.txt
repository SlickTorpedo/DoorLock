The PI uses NetworkManager.

The wifi file is stored at /etc/NetworkManager/system-connections/UAWiFi.nmconnection

Here's how validation goes.
At startup, ping google.com
If it fails with no internet, the PI will write to the nmconnection file.
Then the PI will run sudo systemctl restart NetworkManager which will reconnect to the internet.

If succesful, the PI will remember there was an error connecting to wifi and mention it when unlocking the door.

If unsuccesful, the PI will host the webserver still but it will be unconnectable and I will have to come fix it for you (Plug the PI into my PC and manually configure the WiFi)

Here's an example profile:
