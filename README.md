# DoorLock

## What is it?
DoorLock is an innovative device designed for University of Arizona students, enabling you to unlock your dorm room using your phone or any device connected to U of A’s WiFi. This smart solution eliminates the need for traditional keys and allows for convenient access from anywhere. You can even unlock the door for friends remotely or use voice commands with Siri if your hands are full.

## Why Did I Make It?
I created DoorLock because I find it inconvenient to carry keys everywhere, especially when they are also attached to my car keys. There’s always a risk of losing both if I misplace my keys. DoorLock addresses this issue by providing a modern, keyless solution for accessing my dorm room.

## Can People Make Money Off It?
No. DoorLock is intended for personal use only. You can build one for yourself, but selling the device is not allowed. Please refer to the license included with this project for more details.

## How Long Did It Take?
The design and prototyping of DoorLock took approximately 2 weeks. This period included planning, development, and extensive testing to ensure the device works reliably.

## Does It Have a Website?
Yes, more information about DoorLock can be found on its official website: [doorlock.philipehrbright.com](http://doorlock.philipehrbright.com)

## What Colors Does It Come In?
DoorLock is available in a variety of colors. For a complete list of options, please visit the website.

## Can I Make One Myself?
Absolutely! You are encouraged to build DoorLock for personal use. However, selling the device is prohibited.

## How Much Is It?
The cost of DoorLock is $70. If you and a roommate choose to share, the cost would be $35 each.
